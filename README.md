# Reward-System

Brief Description:
I built this reward system using React JS and Spring Boot following the assignment requirement. After Spring Boot boots, we can start our front web page. We can see there are three input blanks there where we can add our transaction information, such as userID, purchase amount and transaction date by clicking the "add" button. Because this assignment requires me to make up a data set to demonstrate my solution, I just preset three transations there, and of course, you can add more transations. After submit these transations by clicking "submit all" button on the interface, the userID, transation reward points for specific month and total transaction reward points for the whole year will be listed as different record rows.

Boot Instruction:
Under the MAC OS: We first add the backend file as the project in our IDE. After we boot up the spring boot application, we just navigate under the front end dirctory and use " npm installâ€œ and then "npm run start" to start up our frontend part. If the front page does not pop up automatically, we can manually access to it by type "http://localhost:3000/" on the browser.

Thanks, and hope for your reply.
